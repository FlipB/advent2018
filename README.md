# Instructions for Rust setup on OS X with VS Code

Get `rustup` and add to your $PATH.
Debugger `lldb`, should come with XCode.

VS Code Extensions:
 - `Rust (rls)` (preview)
 - `CodeLLDB`
 - `Rust Test Lens` (optional) Doesnt seem to work properly in repos with multiple artifacts
 - `TabSanity` (optional) Helps if you prefer tabs, because rustfmt likes spaces...
